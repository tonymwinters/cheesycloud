I mean, shit, what site doesn't have at least one cool post? So who am I? Well, I'm glad you asked. I'm Tony. And now we're friends. Here's a little somethin' somethin' about me.

Basically, I'm a former Soviet-Union born software engineer, 3D printing maker wanna-be, RC enthusiast, guitarist, gamer and a basic bitch. Meaning, I'm a simple person. A simple person with a ton of interests. This blog will basically explore some of these interests and document my ramblings about them. I don't claim to be the best at any of the above, but I am decent at most of them. 

My goal here is to share with you ideas, product reviews, code samples and other things I find interesting. I'm really glad you internetically stopped by for a visit. Let's grab a beer, da?
